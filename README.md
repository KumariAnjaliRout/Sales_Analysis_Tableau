 Dashboard Summary: Retail Sales Analysis (Tableau + Excel)
This project presents a full Tableau dashboard based on a retail sales dataset consisting of 50,000+ transactions. The goal was to visualize sales performance, product demand, and shipping trends through multiple charts and interactive visuals. Below is an overview of all five charts:

 1. Donut Chart – Sales Distribution by Ship Mode
Visualizes the percentage contribution of each ship mode (Standard Class, Second Class, First Class, Same Day) to total sales. This helps identify customer preferences and shipping performance.

 2. Tree Map – Category-wise Sales Contribution
Shows how product categories like Technology, Furniture, and Office Supplies perform in terms of sales, with further breakdown into sub-categories. This helps understand which products drive the most revenue.

 3. Line Chart – Sales Trend Over Time
Displays sales performance over time (monthly). It reveals seasonal patterns, peak months, and sales dips — helpful for understanding trends and planning marketing or inventory.

 4. Bar Chart – Sales by Region
Illustrates total sales across different regions (Central, East, West, South), making it easy to identify high-performing regions and those with lower contributions.

 5. Horizontal Bar Chart – Top 10 Products by Sales
Ranks the top-selling products based on total sales revenue. This gives a quick view of what items are driving the business forward.

Each chart is cleanly labeled and color-coded, offering actionable insights for decision-makers. The entire analysis was done using Tableau for visualization and Excel for data preprocessing, demonstrating end-to-end data analysis skills.
